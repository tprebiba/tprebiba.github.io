A [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt) GUI for measuring and correcting the tune and beta-beating in the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB).

This application has been used during the Run 3 PSB commissioning for measuring and correcting the injection chicane induced beta-beating and tune distortions. 

Find the source code on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tprebiba/k-modulation-analysis-application-for-psb-and-ps).

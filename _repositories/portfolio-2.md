This repository provides a full simulation pipeline for realistic modeling of beam dynamics in CERN’s Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) using [Xsuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

It includes tools for lattice generation, multi-turn injection and transverse painting modeling, foil scattering, acceleration, time-dependent settings, machine imperfections, space charge effects, tracking and output analysis.

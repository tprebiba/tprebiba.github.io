A series of Python and [Xsuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) exercises for understanding the basics of transverse beam dynamics in synchrotrons. The course material is available on [github](https://github.com/tprebiba/auth-accelerator-physics-xsuite).

The exercises were prepared for the course of *Accelerator Physics* taught by Y. Papaphilippou et al. in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The exercises are heavily based on the [Hands-On Lattice and Longitudinal Calculations - Python version](https://github.com/cerncas/hands-on-lattice-exercises) course of the [CERN Accelerator School (CAS)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1226773/).

Contributed to the following courses:
- AUTH 2025 Summer Semester (online).
- AUTH 2024 Summer Semester (online).

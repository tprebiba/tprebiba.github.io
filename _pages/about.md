Welcome to my personal space! Here, you'll find a collection of **repositories**, **articles**, **talks**, and other things that spark my curiosity.

I'm an accelerator physicist at CERN, focusing on the beam intensity reach of the LHC injectors. I have a strong interest in **physics simulation codes**, **data analysis** and **physics outreach**.

Feel free to reach out &mdash; my contact information is just a click away :)
